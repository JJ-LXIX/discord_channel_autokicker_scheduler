# discord_channel_autokicker_scheduler

Use the code to self host your own discord bot that kicks everyone from channels at a particular time scheduled by you.

Be sure to add the server ID to the TOKEN variable found in the code.

The "datetime.time(x, y, z)" refers to the time that you want to schedule (x = hour,y = minute and z = seconds, example: datetime.time(13, 18, 0)).

Be sure to also change the timezone if required.
